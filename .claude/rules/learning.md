# Learning Rules

- **Multi-domain, not just code:** Vorbit covers design, implementation, and process. Learning capture must work across ALL domains — not assume everything is code changes or git diffs.
- **No personal junk drawer:** Every learning routes to repo-level (CLAUDE.md, `.claude/rules/`), org-level, or skill-level. If it can't be placed, it's not worth keeping.
