# Skills Rules

- **Explore skill 10+ question quota:** Explore skill mandates 10+ questions in batches of 3-4 via AskUserQuestion before synthesizing options. Ensures sufficient context gathering before recommendations.
- **Respect explore → PRD → implement flow boundaries** — stay in brainstorming mode during `/explore` until the user explicitly signals they want to move to execution. After explore completes, the next step is always PRD creation, not implementation. Never jump phases.
- **Ask before creating a PRD** — when the user asks to create a PRD, first ask what should go in it. Never auto-populate from in-progress brainstorming or treat exploration outputs as settled requirements.
