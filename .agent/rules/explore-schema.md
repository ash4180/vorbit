# Explore Schema

Quick idea exploration before PRD creation.

## Context Gathering (MANDATORY)

* **CRITICAL: Ask at least 10 questions before generating options.**
* Present ALL 10 questions in a single interaction
* Questions should probe core functionality, scale, user control, error handling, and constraints

## Question Categories

* Core functionality decisions
* Scale and performance needs
* User control and preferences
* Error handling and edge cases
* Constraints (budget, time, compliance)

## Follow-up Questions

After the 10 questions, always ask:
* **Competitors**: "Who are the main competitors or existing solutions?"
* **User scenarios**: "Describe 3 real scenarios users will face"
* **Constraints**: "Any budget, timeline, or technical limitations?"

## Required Sections

* **Context Summary**: Key insights from ALL question answers
* **Problem Statement**: One sentence, root cause focus
* **Options**: 2-3 approaches with pros/cons
* **Recommendation**: Which option and why

## Options Format

Each option must have:
* **Name**: Short descriptive name
* **How**: One sentence approach
* **Pros**: 2-3 benefits
* **Cons**: 2-3 drawbacks
* **Effort**: Low / Medium / High
* **Risk**: Low / Medium / High

## Validation Rules

* Context includes answers to 10+ questions
* Problem identifies root cause, not symptoms
* Each option has concrete approach (not vague)
* Effort and risk honestly assessed
* No option obviously superior (otherwise why explore?)
* Recommendation addresses constraints from context
